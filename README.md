Title: Development of a Quantum-Resistant, Dynamic Binary Encoding System Using Overlaid Tessellated Triangles and “Hat” Tiles

Principal Investigator: Hunter Jensen

Abstract:
This research proposes the development of a novel encryption system combining tessellated triangles and nonperiodic “hat” tiles to create a dynamic, quantum-resistant binary encoding structure. By allowing user-defined sizes for the triangular elements and overlaying them with fixed-size “hat” tiles, this system aims to provide a highly secure method of data encryption, resilient against quantum computing attacks.

1. Introduction:
In the era of advancing quantum computing, traditional encryption methods face potential vulnerabilities. This project, conceptualized by Hunter Jensen, explores an innovative approach to encryption using geometric tessellations and nonperiodic tiling to encode binary data dynamically.

2. Methodology:

	•	2.1 Tessellated Triangle Graph: Develop a dynamic graph of tessellated triangles, with user-defined sizes for each triangular element.

	•	2.2 Nonperiodic “Hat” Tile Graph: Design a graph of fixed-size, nonperiodic “hat” tiles to overlay the triangular tessellation.

	•	2.3 Overlay Process: Implement an algorithm for overlaying the “hat” tile graph onto the triangular tessellation, maintaining the integrity of the underlying pattern.

4. Information Encoding:

	•	3.1 Binary Encoding: Develop a method to encode binary data using the combined pattern of tessellated triangles and “hat” tiles.

	•	3.2 Error Correction and Security: Incorporate advanced error correction techniques and assess the system’s resilience against quantum computing attacks.

5. Decoding Algorithm:

	•	4.1 Development of Decoding Algorithm: Create a sophisticated algorithm capable of decoding the complex overlay pattern, adaptable to different sizes and configurations.
