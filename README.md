Quantum-Resistant Geometric Encryption System

Overview

This repository contains the research and development work for a novel encryption system conceptualized by Hunter Jensen. The system utilizes a dynamic overlay of tessellated triangles and nonperiodic “hat” tiles to create a quantum-resistant binary encoding structure. This project aims to develop a highly secure method of data encryption, resilient against emerging quantum computing threats.
